              <p>
                The combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural
                gas in power plants, vehicles, and industrial processes releases
                a variety of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon
                monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter
                (PM). These pollutants contribute to smog, acid rain, and
                respiratory problems.

            <div class="grid-item" id="item2">
              <h2>Industrial Emissions</h2>
              <p>
                Factories and industrial activities emit significant amounts of
                pollutants, including hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds
                (VOCs), carbon monoxide, and other chemicals. These degrade air
                quality and can lead to health issues such as respiratory and
                cardiovascular diseases.

                pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
                hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (PM). These emissions
                contribute significantly to urban air pollution and smog

                Agriculture contributes to air pollution through the release of
                ammonia (NH3) from fertilizers and animal waste, as well as
                pesticides and insecticides. Additionally, practices like
                burning crop residues release harmful gases and particulate
                matter into the atmosphere.

                    Air pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides
                    (NOₓ) cause acid rain, which damages soil, water bodies, and

                    Individuals can significantly reduce air pollution by
                    adopting sustainable transportation habits. Walking or
                    biking for short trips can greatly decrease vehicle
                    emissions. Using public transportation like buses, trains,
                    or subways instead of personal vehicles also helps reduce
                    the number of cars on the road. Carpooling with fri​ends or
                    colleagues is another effective way to lower vehicle use and
                    cut emissions.

                  ​Conserving energy at home is crucial for preventing air
                  pollution. Turning off lights and unplugging appliances when
                  not in use saves energy and reduces emissions. Using
                  energy-efficient products like ENERGY STAR-rated appliances
                  and LED bulbs can significantly cut energy consumption.

                  ​Effective waste management practices are essential for
                  reducing air pollution. Recycling and reusing materials can
                  minimize pollution from waste processing. Composting yard
                  waste instead of burning it prevents the release of harmful
                  pollutants into the air.

                  ​Using non-toxic cleaning products and low-VOC paints can
                  reduce the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into
                  the air. Limiting the use of wood-burning fireplaces and
                  s​toves, and considering gas logs instead, can also help
                  reduce indoor air pollution.​ Additionally, using electric or
                  hand-powered lawn equipment instead of gas-powered engines can
                  significantly reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.

                  ​Supporting clean air initiatives and participating in local
                  programs aimed at reducing air pollution can have a profound
                  impact. Engaging in tree planting activities not only helps
                  absorb pollutants but also significantly improves air
                  quality.
